  <p><em>A recap of our June Meeting</em></p>

<h2>June Meeting</h2>
<p> The June meeting for P(CC)^2 was held at the Sylvania campus in TCB 215. There was pizza from Flying Pie Pizzeria available, as well as soft drinks! Club President Will Wheatley-Uhl and Treasurer Syn Calvo guided atendees through the agenda, which covered conversations about our Club Funding, Club Web Presence, and Document Repositories.</p>

<h3>Log Parsing with Ford Tennis:</h3>
<p>Club Secretary, Ford Tennis, hosted an in-depth demo about Log Parsing, and the best ways to extract critical data from complicated Log files with basic tools. Ford demonstrated the use of these tools with actual NCL Challenge questions, drawn from past seasons. We talked about the value of basic text manipulation tools such as <strong>grep</strong> and <strong>awk</strong>, and how to use them to best obtain the desired results.</p>

  </ul>

<h3>CTF's and <strong>You</strong>:</h3>
<p>Ever impressed with the sound of his own voice, Club President Will Wheatley-Uhl offered meeting attendees with an explanation Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, and how can help aspiring Cybersecurity Professionals hone their skills in realistic simulations. P(CC)^2 members will most likely be forming the majority of PCC's National Cyber League Team, facing off with thousands of other like-midnded students in a Cybersecurity / Ethical Hacking competition. Will's explanation of CTF's and their composite pieces was to help inform the uninitiated of what to expect when competing in a CTF's, such as the NCL. Will covered what kinds of challenges are typically featured in the NCL, as well as covering a number of training resources that members could use to learn the requisite skills. This talk will be the beginning of a series of NCL Training Talks and Demonstrations designed to prepare Club Members for future CTF Competitions!
