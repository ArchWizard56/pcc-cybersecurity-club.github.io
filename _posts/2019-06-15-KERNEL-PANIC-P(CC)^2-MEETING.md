<em>What to expect at our Upcoming Meeting!</em>

![l33t H4x0Rz 0nLy!](/assets/images/06-26-2019.jpg)<br>
The time has come once more, for PCC's most 1337 club to meet!

P(CC)^2 will be holding it's monthly meeting for June on Wednesday June 26th, 7:30-9:30PM in TCB 215  at Sylvania. We'll be recognizing some new official members, as well as guiding any students interested in joining our club through the registration process. This meeting will be open to the public, so if you're on the fence about joining, and want to see what we're all about, this is a great opportunity to do so!

<em>"What kinds of events can I expect to transpire at this meeting?"</em>, you ask? Well, here are some of the planned topics of conversation:

<ul>
    <li>Log Parsing and the 'XY Problem' with Ford Tennis: NCL competitor and Log Guru will go over the best ways to find data hidden in log files, and what tools and techniques are handy. In addition to a Regex Refresher, Ford will talk about the best way to reach out and ask for help with technical issues with a discussion about the "XY Problem".</li>
    <li>CTF Competitions and You: What is "Capture the Flag"? How can a Capture the Flag style competitions and games help you learn Cybersecurity Concepts? What is the National Cyber League, and what does it have to do with Norwegian Cruise Lines (hint: very little)?</li>
    <li>NCL Fall Season Pre-Training: We'll be establishing a training plan for the next NCL season, and offering a list of resources potential participants may find useful for the competition.</li>
    <li>Hacker Show & Tell: Got a cool book, piece of tech, or project you want to show off? This is the place!</li>
</ul>
