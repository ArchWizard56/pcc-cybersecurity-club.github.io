<h3>Shout Outs - Team Game</h3>
<p>All three teams representing PCC2 rocked the leaderboards and had a blast doing it.  Teams communicate via separate Discord servers throughout the event and use an organized Google spreadsheet to keep track of questions and answers before submission, which helps keep accuracy high.</p>

<p>Thank you, Team Captains, for the work you put in to get these teams together and setup the communication environments!  We appreciate you!</p>

<h3>Shout Outs - Individual Game:</h3>
<p>Kort Witkowski (2395 points out of 3000) and William Wheatley-Uhl (2245 points out of 3000) both placed in the top 100 out of 4,149 competitors.  Congratulations gentlemen!</p>

<p>We had quite a few members this year that had never competed before and we would like to recognize everyone’s hard work preparing for and competing in such a tough event!  Watch out Spring Season, we’re coming for you next!</p>
