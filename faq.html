<h3>What is Discord and why would I use it?</h3>

browser. We use it to stay in touch on a daily basis with all members. The real question is why
wouldn’t you use it!? Come chat with us, make suggestions, offer advice, get help, or share
dank memes.</p></br>

<h3>Can guests attend monthly club meetings and join the Discord server?</h3>

  join the <a href="https://discord.gg/BjJq56E">Discord</a> server or check out our calendar for the next meeting 
  details and sit in for a bit to see what it's about.  We'd love to meet you and answer any questions you might have.</p></br>

<h3>What does it cost to be a member?</h3>
<p>Membership dues are a minimum donation of $25 due upon registration and again annually on or before your anniversary of becoming a member.  Dues are accepted by the Treasurer via Cash, Venmo, or Paypal.  Officers will attempt to send out reminders when membership dues are coming due, but this is currently a manual process. Members can view their anniversary date and elapsed days in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18hA_YApZzsIMqaLGoGSISj51GmxtJtO2jJxnCy7NNWU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">private roster</a>.</p></br>

<h3>What if I want to be a member, but can’t afford the annual dues?</h3>
<p>You’re in luck! Scholarships are available on an as needed basis. Please contact 
  our Treasurer via email at <a href="mailto:william.wheatleyuhl@pcc.edu">william.wheatleyuhl@pcc.edu</a> or 
  on Discord at <a href="https://discord.com/users/326781297567727626">shipwreck#2501</a> to request a scholarship.</p></br>

<h3>How do I sign up for the club?</h3>
<p>Check out our <a href="/membership.html">Membership</a> page and follow the "Steps to Apply."</p></br>

<h3>Who should I contact if I have a club-related issue or complaint?</h3>
<p>Any <a href="/roster.html">officer or faculty advisor</a> of P(CC)<sup>2</sup> that you’re comfortable with can champion your cause.
Please don’t hesitate to reach out. Complaints will be kept anonymous and confidential.</p></br>
