<h3>It's All Will's Fault:</h3>
  <p>It was a simple proposition on a chat server, April 16th, 2019 when preparing for the team competition in the National Cyber League's Spring Season that started it all:</p>

<p><em>"...NCL sent me another email about it, was the potential formation of a PCC CyberSecurity 'Club' as a sanctioned school organization. I wanted to see if anyone associated with this chat or the NCL season we're currently in had any interest in looking into something like that."  <br>~Will Wheatley-Uhl</em></p>

<p>We ran with it.  Okay, we didn’t run...we’re nerds...the only thing we run are commands, programs, and scripts.  But we did have interest and it wasn’t long before we were discussing the potential for such a club.  Ten days later, we had a list of “Topics to consider for the formation of a PCC CyberSecurity Club” and the dream was born.  Founding Officers were nominated, goals were discussed, bylaws written, and a name was chosen:</p>

Portland Community College CyberSecurity Club<br>

or<br>

PCC^2 (PCC squared) for short</p>
<h3>Founding Officers:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Faculty Advisor:   Po-Chin Cheng</li>
  <li>President:    Will Wheatley-Uhl</li>
  <li>Vice President:    Paul Hochstetler</li>
  <li>Secretary:    Ford Tennis</li>
  <li>Treasurer:    Syn Calvo</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Original Mission</h3>
<p><em>“To bring awareness of the opportunities in CyberSecurity and expand the knowledge of students in the field via meetings, workshops, and other CyberSecurity related events.”</em></p>

<h3>Going Official</h3>
<p>PCC^2 is affiliated with the National CyberSecurity Student Association as a student chapter and formally chartered by Portland Community College.</p>

<p>The first official Club Meeting was held on Wednesday, May 22nd, 2019 at 7:30PM at a member’s residence and being the first, was open to all students and faculty of PCC, including non-members.  We had tacos galore, great conversations, a slideshow presentation from our President, and recognized instructor Jim Santmyer for his contributions to PCC over many years, congratulating him on his retirement with cake and ice cream!  Meeting Minutes from this event can be found here:</p>

<p>Future Club Meetings will be held on the 4th Wednesday of each month and will be members-only with exceptions for guest speakers and / or pre-approved potential members.  If you’re interested in attending, please contact us!</p>
